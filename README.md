# STM32L432KC
STM32 Rust Baremetal Code

HAL Layer Code for the STM32L432KC

Code project originally began on Gitlab, moved over to Github.

All testing of HAL layer will be done in the project with the intent of then creating a library 

The goal of this project is not to replace any other projects, however be simple enough to show others how to interface with the raw data registers, hardware layer thus creating a HAL without the need for any additional libraries
